# Gatsby Image visualiser and explorer

This project is a way of visually exploring what each part of the GraphQL query you pass into the awesome [gatsby-plugin-sharp](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/) does and how that is output by the equally amazing [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/).

There are already many docs around their use ad this is one of the other fantastic aspects of using Gatsby - their docs rock - this is more as a way of understanding the inputs and outputs of this pair of code buddies.
