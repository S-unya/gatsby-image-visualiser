-   TS is great for catching certain types of errors early, but it is for people
-   There are many setups for TS, I use strict and back it up with linting rules
-   TS Errors are not bad to get, they are a chance to learn and make our application better
-   Reading TS Errors
-   Bad types are worse than no types
    -   eg use of any, unknown, never
-   Allow inference
    -   declare data shapes early
    -   declare expectations
-   Local types vs global types
-   Some TS things that are not available in other typed langs
